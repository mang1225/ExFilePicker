## Customization

ExFilePicker library provide two themes for ExFilePicker's activity: dark and light (ExFilePickerThemeDark and ExFilePickerThemeLight respectively). If you need to customize ExFilePicker's activity view, you can extend your own theme from any ExFilePicker's theme and override needed options.

## Sample Application
